## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite Applications & Features:

    Instagram:
        - Bookmarking/saving posts
        - Accessing peoples threads account from their profile
    
    TikTok:
        - Reposting things on your for-you page for your friends to see
        - Turning turn on captions for videos
        - Saving TikTok sounds and effects
    
    Spotify:
        - Sleep Timer (will stop playing music after a certain amount of time)
        - Listening History (Shows what playlist and songs listended to each day)
        - Enhance (suggests new songs that are similar on the current playlist)
        
App Idea:

    I want to test and enhance a certain TikTok feature for my application. Many individuals express their interest to be able to automatically scoll through TikTok, allowing them to watch content without the need for manual scrolling. I aim to try and implement this feature.
    
    
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

    One of the challenges I faced was within Step 3 which was Connecting UI to Logic. Looking back now, I was definitally overthinking, but when it came down to the change background function, I kept writing the code outside of the IBAction function, so when I ran the simulator, the background wouldnt change when I pressed the button.
